A client requested a website with a "retro-tech" look. Unfortunately, the client's business never saw the light of day, but I felt that the work I put into it is still interesting enough to show off. What you're looking at is a "3D layout" script. It injects a window-sized canvas element into the page, and it treats HTML elements as if they were being seen top-down in a one-point perspective.

The code could very likely use some cleanup(and I'm still interested enough in it that I may very well revisit it at some time in the future), but the foundation is there and working rather well.

You can see it action [here](http://lowtolerance.github.com/Popout.js)(and also a somewhat more practical example [here](http://lowtolerance.github.com/Popout.js/index-alt.html)).
